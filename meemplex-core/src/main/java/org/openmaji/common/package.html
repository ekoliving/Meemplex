This package contains the common Maji Facets.
</p>

<p>
The {@link org.openmaji.common.Binary Binary},
{@link org.openmaji.common.Linear Linear} and
{@link org.openmaji.common.Variable Variable} Facets are
the most basic and common types that are used across a number of different
domains.
</p>

<p>
A {@link org.openmaji.common.Binary Binary}
represents something that can be modeled as either true/false or on/off.
</p>

<p>
A {@link org.openmaji.common.Linear Linear} is
something that represents a fixed value within a bounded linearly increasing range. The value is
represented with an instance of {@link org.openmaji.common.Position Position}.
</p>

<p>
A {@link org.openmaji.common.Variable Variable} is
something that can store a {@link org.openmaji.common.Value Value},
concrete instances of which are 
{@link org.openmaji.common.NumberValue NumberValue} and
{@link org.openmaji.common.StringValue StringValue}.
</p>

<p>
A {@link org.openmaji.common.Unary Unary} represents a command 
to trigger tasks.
</p>

<p>
A {@link org.openmaji.common.Multistate Multistate} represents 
something that has a {@link org.openmaji.common.State State},
abstract implementation of which is 
{@link org.openmaji.common.AbstractState AbstractState}.
