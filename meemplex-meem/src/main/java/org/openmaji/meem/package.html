      Maji distributed component and it's constituent pieces. 
    </p>
    <p>
      A complete Maji system consists of a number of modules ...
      <ul>
        <li>
          Maji Meem API - Packages used for developing a Meem
        </li>
        <li>
          Maji System API - Packages used for developing a system of Meems
        </li>
        <li>
          Maji Server implementation - An environment for running Meem systems
        </li>
        <li>
          MeemKit(s) - Domain specific collection of existing Meem patterns
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>org.openmaji.meem</i> packages define the <b>Maji Meem API</b>.
      The following description is a general introduction to Meems, which
      are specified by this API.
      More specific documentation can be found in the individual packages
      and class files that comprise the Maji Meem API.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <b>Meem</b> is a self-contained, self-describing, distributed
      component that is strongly encapsulated behind <b>Facet</b>s,
      i.e. Java interfaces, that are implemented by one or more <b>Wedges</b>,
      i.e. Java implementation.
      All systems components of the Maji system are themselves Meems.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Meem programming model can be considered from both "within the Meem",
      i.e. internal or local, and "between Meems", i.e. external or remote.
      In both cases, method invocations are fully asynchronous and don't
      have "return values", i.e. all methods return void.
      This is best thought of as an event based model, in which method
      invocations are used as a convenient way of sending and receiving events.
      All required functionality is usually abstracted behind Java interfaces
      that appear as either Facets (external) or Conduits (internal).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Meem's meta-information describes all of the constituent pieces that
      are used to assemble a functioning Meem.
      This Meem definition can be viewed and updated whilst the Meem is loaded
      in a JVM.  
      This means that Meems within a Maji system can be developed and changed,
      without having to stop the complete distributed system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Functionality specified by the Maji system as being required by every
      Meem, e.g. life cycle and persistence, is defined by system Facets and
      implemented by system Wedges.
      Much of this functionality is made available locally via system defined
      <b>Conduit</b>s.
      This pluggable functionality is automatically provided by the system
      once the Meem is assembled.
      This means that an application developer needs only to define and
      implement Facets, Wedges and Conduits, specific to the application needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The local programming model is "design-by-composition", in which the
      required functionality is abstracted using Java interfaces.
      All of the Java implementation is contained in the Wedges.
      Meem assembly uses the <b>MeemDefinition</b> to load all of the Meem's
      pieces into a singular and complete distributed component.
      A given Wedge can communicate within the Meem by creating it's own
      Conduits or by using the Conduits of other Wedges within the same Meem.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remote programming model is "componentized design-by-interface" and
      by dynamically building relationships between Meems that handle failure.
      Unidirectional <b>Dependencies</b> between two Meems with similarly
      typed Facets can be created at any time.
      The direction of the information flow is determined by the connection of
      an outbound Facet to an inbound Facet.
      Various system Wedges deal with the management of Dependencies between
      Meems, including registration, location, one-to-many, many-to-one,
      authentication, encryption and partial failure. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Collections of Meems can be organized and viewed in many different ways.
      Some views are related to development processes, e.g. deployment, other
      views are specific to a given application domain.
      Within a Maji system, a Space consists of numerous <b>Categories</b>,
      each of which may contain a collection of relevant Meems.
      Any Meem may simultaneously be categoried in multiple, different ways.
