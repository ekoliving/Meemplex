Development Notes
=================

Meemkits
--------

Each meemkit is an OSGI bundle.

A few rules must be followed:
	- include the MANIFEST.MF header "Eclipse-RegisterBuddy: org.meemplex.meemserver" to allow MeemServer to access the meemkit's classes.
	- register meemkit with meemit OSGI service: e.g. "meemkitRegistration = bundleContext.registerService(MeemkitService.class, meemkitService, null);"
	  Do this on bundle start().  The meemkit will be picked up by the meemserver.
	- ...	


UI
--

Use the org.meemplex.internet.gwt meemkit for web UI.

There use by creating a Meem with a WAR application wedge along-side an Embedded Jetty wedge


TODO
----

Meemkit initialisation:
	- Check for patterns that are already installed, and create/update those that are new or have changed.
