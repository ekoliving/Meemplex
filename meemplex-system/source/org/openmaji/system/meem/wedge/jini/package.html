The Jini wedge package is provided to allow people to create meems which can also publish Jini services.
</p>
<p>
In the simplest case the meem definition for a meem providing a Jini service
would be just an application wedge and the Exporter wedge. So the meem 
definition might be created like:
<pre>
	meemDefinition = MeemDefinitionFactory.spi.create().createMeemDefinition(new Class[] { Exporter.class, MyJiniServiceWedge.class });
</pre>
</p>
<p>
MyJiniService would then either be the appropriate java.rmi.Remote object or be the producer of java.rmit.Remote objects which were passed to the <code>exportableServiceConduit</code> via a conduit definition included in <code>MyJiniServiceWedge</code>.
</p>
<p>
By way of a brief example, we could imagine a simple service implementing the
following RMI capable interface:
<pre>
import java.io.Serializable;
import java.rmi.Remote;
import java.rmi.RemoteException;

/**
 * A service that prepends "Hello" to the passed in name.
 */
public interface SayHello
    extends Remote, Serializable
{
    public String sayHello(String name)
        throws RemoteException;
}
</pre>
In the case where the wedge was producing service objects, but did not provide
the service itself, the wedge would publish the service to the meemserver and subsequently to Jini with the following code:
<pre>
    exportableServiceConduit.serviceAdded("helloService", new SayHelloImplementation(), null);
</pre>
and withdraw it by calling:
<pre>
    exportableServiceConduit.serviceRemoved("helloService");
</pre>
alternately, if the wedge class is also providing the service, rather than <code>SayHelloImplementation</code> we would just pass <code>this</code>. The <code>exportableServiceConduit</code> is declared as:
<pre>
    public ExportableServiceConduit  exportableServiceConduit;
</pre>
<p>
Jini also provides the facility to provide entry descriptors for services it
publishes. The final parameter in the <code>serviceAdded</code> method above is provided
for this purpose and if used should consist of a list of <code>net.jini.core.entry.Entry objects</code>.
