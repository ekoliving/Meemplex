This package contains the Facets used to model device controllers as Meems.
A {@link net.majitek.meemkit.automation.controller.DeviceController device controller}
provides a gateway between the world of Meems and the world of hardware devices.
It is also responsible for managing the life cycle of Meem devices so that they reflect the
{@link net.majitek.meemkit.automation.device.DeviceHealth health} of their corresponding
hardware devices.
</p>

<p>
A device controller is a
{@link net.majitek.meemkit.automation.controller.RequestProcessor command processor} and
accepts commands generated by Meem devices and sends them on to the corresponding
hardware device. The controller may then optionally notify all
{@link net.majitek.meemkit.automation.controller.DeviceControllerClient device controller clients}
of any state updates. Note that some hardware networks do not provide state or command feedback.
</p>

<p>
A controller may use a
{@link net.majitek.meemkit.automation.controller.HeartbeatProcessor heartbeat processor}
to keep a sense of the health of the network as a whole.
A {@link net.majitek.meemkit.automation.controller.DeviceDiscoverer device discoverer}
can discover, either actively or passively, what hardware devices are on a network.
