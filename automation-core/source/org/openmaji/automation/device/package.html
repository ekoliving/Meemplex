The Automation Device package contains the Facets and basic Java Interfaces that
are used to model hardware devices as Meems.
</p>

<p>
Hardware devices are physically connected to some sort of network and can be remotely controlled
by some sort of {@link net.majitek.meemkit.automation.controller.DeviceController controller}
or master device. Some hardware networks also provide
a means to query the {@link net.majitek.meemkit.automation.device.DeviceState state}
and {@link net.majitek.meemkit.automation.device.DeviceHealth health} of a device.
</p>

<p>
Each device has a unique {@link net.majitek.meemkit.automation.address.Address address}.
This allows the controller to send {@link net.majitek.meemkit.automation.device.Command commands}
to specific devices.
