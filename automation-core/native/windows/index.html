RXTX isn't required for Windows.

How to build the custom comms.jar for Windows
---------------------------------------------

Because the 2.0.2 windows version of javax.comm libraries from sun don't 
work if you have a security manager installed, but the 2.0.3 solaris/sparc does,
to make it work on windows, do the following:

Download both 2.0.2 windows and 2.0.3 solaris/sparc versions of the javax.comm 
libraries from http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm/downloads/index.html

Unjar both versions of comm.jar into seperate directories.

Copy 

NotificationThread.class
Win32Driver.class
Win32ParallelPort.class
Win32SerialPort.class
Win32SerialInputStream.class
Win32SerialOutputStream.class

from the windows com/sun/comm/ directory into the corresponing solaris directory.

Copy the relevant contents (ie: the digest info for the above files) from the 
windows META-INF/Manifest file into the solaris manifest file.

Rebuild comm.jar using the command

jar cfm comm.jar META-INF\Manifest .

This jar will now contain the windows driver and will work with a security manager
installed.
