Java Communications API - javax.comm.jar
http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm

	The Java Communications API is used by anything that requires
	serial line communications, e.g. X10 library.

	This JAR is a composite of ...

		Solaris "comm.jar" version 2.0.2
		Windows "comm.jar" version 2.0

	... where the Windows specific implementation (com.sun.com.Win32*)
	was copied into the Solaris JAR and then renamed "javax.comm.jar".
	For further details, please see

		../native/windows/build-instructions.txt

	This was done to avoid a bizarre Windows error.

	This JAR should work on all of Linux, Windows and Solaris,
	because it contains the generic Java standard API (javax.comm),
	plus the Windows specific implementation, which will be ignored
	on Unix / Linux systems.

	On Unix, using JavaComm JARs older than version 2.0.2 will result
	in the following error message ...

		"java.lang.NullPointerException: name can't be null
		 while loading driver gnu.io.RXTXCommDriver"

	... when utilizing JavaComm with applications that also use
	the RMI SecurityManager !

Java Communications Library (Linux: RxTx) - jcl.jar
http://www.rxtx.org

	Java Communications Library (JCL) that contains the Java Native
	Interface to the Linux RxTx Driver (gnu.io.RXTXCommDriver).
	If you are using Windoze, you can ignore this.
	
	Normally, you'd compile RxTx on your Linux system and install it in
	the JDK/JRE Library Extensions area.  This works fine, if you run
	Maji standalone, i.e. not in InterMajik.  Unfortunately, if you
	attempt to use serial communications, e.g. X10, from InterMajik,
	then it ends up being a little ugly.
	
	Ths simpliest way to move forward seemed to be to put the "jcl.jar"
	into the "majitek-meemkit-automation-core" MeemKit and fix up the
	"fragment.xml" to reference this JAR.  This allows the InterMajik
	plug-in to find "jcl.jar" as required.
	
	If anyone knows of an easier and/or better way to do this ...
	... then "go for it".
	
	This version of "jcl.jar" was compiled from RxTx version 2.0-7pre2.
	The resulting "RXTXcomm.jar" was renamed to "jcl.jar".

	It is *crucial* that the version of "jcl.jar" exactly matches the
	versions of ...

		../native/linux/jre/lib/i386/librxtxParallel.so
		../native/linux/jre/lib/i386/librxtxSerial.so
