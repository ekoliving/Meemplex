public class EmbededTomcatTest {
//	Instantiate a new instance of this class. 
//	Set the relevant properties of this object itself. In particular, you will want to establish the default Logger to be used, as well as the default Realm if you are using container-managed security. 
//	Call createEngine() to create an Engine object, and then call its property setters as desired. 
//	Call createHost() to create at least one virtual Host associated with the newly created Engine, and then call its property setters as desired. After you customize this Host, add it to the corresponding Engine with engine.addChild(host). 
//	Call createContext() to create at least one Context associated with each newly created Host, and then call its property setters as desired. You SHOULD create a Context with a pathname equal to a zero-length string, which will be used to process all requests not mapped to some other Context. After you customize this Context, add it to the corresponding Host with host.addChild(context). 
//	Call addEngine() to attach this Engine to the set of defined Engines for this object. 
//	Call createConnector() to create at least one TCP/IP connector, and then call its property setters as desired. 
//	Call addConnector() to attach this Connector to the set of defined Connectors for this object. The added Connector will use the most recently added Engine to process its received requests. 
//	Repeat the above series of steps as often as required (although there will typically be only one Engine instance created). 
//	Call start() to initiate normal operations of all the attached components.
